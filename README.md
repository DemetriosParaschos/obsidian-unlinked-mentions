# Obsidian Unlinked Mentions Report

This Python script scans your Obsidian vault for unlinked mentions of note titles and aliases. It produces a contextual report that helps improve internal linking in your notes.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Parses aliases from YAML frontmatter
- Cleans notes from LaTeX, code, links, and optionally callouts
- Detects multiple context-rich unlinked mentions
- Generates a `.md` report with suggested links and context

---

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone or download the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project_root.git
cd project_root
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The vault path is read from an environment variable:

```bash
export VAULT_PATH="/path/to/your/obsidian/vault"
```

If not set, the script uses the default path hardcoded in `config.py`.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

After setting up everything, simply run:

```bash
python -m project_root
```

You will be prompted whether to exclude Obsidian callout blocks. After scanning, a new file called:

```
00 - Unlinked Mentions Report.md
```

...will be generated in your vault directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è What is `pyproject.toml`?

The `pyproject.toml` file is a modern way to define your Python project's metadata and build system. It:
- Replaces `setup.py` for most uses
- Declares dependencies and Python version
- Allows easy installation via `pip`
- Supports packaging your project as a module (if you wish to distribute it later)

If you're just running the script, you don't *need* to touch this file. But it's good practice to have it included.

## üìÇ Files
- `__main__.py`: Starts the program
- `config.py`: Holds vault path and file settings
- `processor.py`: Main logic and report generation
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for cleaning, parsing, and context extraction
- `requirements.txt`: List of needed Python packages
- `pyproject.toml`: Packaging and metadata definition
- `.gitignore`: Tells Git which files/folders to ignore
- `LICENSE`: MIT License (free to use and share)

## üß† Tip
If you want to share this project or reuse it across multiple devices, just remember to:
- Set your `VAULT_PATH` properly
- Regenerate the virtual environment (`python3 -m venv venv`)
- Run the script with `python -m project_root`

Happy linking! üß†üîó
